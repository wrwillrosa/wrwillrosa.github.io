I'm Will,
a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience building APIs for SaaS platforms with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) ([Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) ([PHP](https://www.php.net/)),
managing spatial and time series data with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/),
and leading product engineering teams in startups, SMBs, and government agencies in the US, Australia, and Brazil.

With a proven track record of automating processes,
modernizing legacy applications,
and reducing cloud costs in industries like PropTech, HRTech, and environmental monitoring,
I value working remotely in small teams and in close collaboration with clients.

This blog is where I share my notes and thoughts on technology.
